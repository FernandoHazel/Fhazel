            <h2>I was the producer and programmer of a project developed with Unity on a mouse that ventures into a mansion full of traps and enemies to find food for his family, one of its most interesting mechanics is that the more food you collect your weight increases so your ability to jump, overcome obstacles and escape is reduced. As a player you will be forced to think strategically in this fun puzzle platform game. I worked on the character movement, the UI behavior, implemented the animations, worked on the inventory system as well as the save system.</h2>
