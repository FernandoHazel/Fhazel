            <h2>TQM is a page that I developed as a freelance with Nodejs for a chemical solutions company such as water treatment, heaters and boilers. This was a project that I developed only as a freelance, I had to design the structure of the site, organize the information of the company, modify the styles of the page and apply the functionalities, in addition to helping the client to migrate his site from his old hosting to new one.</h2>
