            <h2>I was the producer and programmer of a project made with Unity about a lazy bee that instead of working decides to steal pollen from her sisters, this stealth game is designed for a casual audience and is full of irreverent humor. I worked on the movement of the character, the UI behavior and the collect feature as well as the save system. This game was mentioned as the best project of that semester for which I am proud.</h2>
